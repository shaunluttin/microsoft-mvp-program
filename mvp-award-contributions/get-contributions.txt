Title                : Design Principles with C# & TypeScript examples
Description          : Familiarity with object-oriented design principles helps us write loosely-coupled code, which is easier to maintain, change, and reuse. The Gang of Four 
                       Design Patterns provide canonical, battle-tested examples of those principles in action. While the presentation gives examples in C# and TypeScript, design 
                       principles are language agnostic: regardless of our software language of choice. As we increase our understanding of design principles, we also improve our 
                       ability as object-oriented software developers.

Title                : Microsoft Azure for Developers Camp
Description          : Use Visual Studio, Git Deploy, and Azure Web Apps to quickly test out development scenarios. This talk will cover using NuGet in Visual Studio to keep 
                       assemblies out of version control. We'll cover using Git within Visual Studio to commit locally and then push to a remote server (in the demo, we'll use 
                       GitHub.) Next, we'll setup an Azure Web App and connect it to GitHub for deployment from version control. The lightweight workflow allows quick scenario 
                       testing in which we spin up an Azure Web App and tear it down when we've finished. Time permitting, we'll touch on using multiple deployment slots in Azure 
                       Web Apps and multiple Git branches to enable other testing options.
