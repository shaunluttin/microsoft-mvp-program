Title                : Design Principles with C# & TypeScript examples
Description          : From the presentation's description: "Familiarity with object-oriented design principles helps us write loosely-coupled code, which is easier to maintain, 
                       change, and reuse. The Gang of Four Design Patterns provide canonical, battle-tested examples of those principles in action. While the presentation gives 
                       examples in C# and TypeScript, design principles are language agnostic: regardless of our software language of choice. As we increase our understanding of 
                       design principles, we also improve our ability as object-oriented software developers."
